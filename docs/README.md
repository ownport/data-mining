# Data mining

## Pattern discovery

- Pattern mining methods: Apriori, ECLAT, FPgrowth
- Pattern evaluation issues: lift, chi-square, cosine, Jaccard, Kulczynski
- Mining diverse patterns
- Mining multi-level, multi-dimensional patterns
- Qualitative patterns
- Negative correlations
- Compressed patterns
- Redundancy-aware top-k patterns
- Sequential pattern mining methods: GSP, SPADE, PrefixSapn, CloSpan
- Mining spatiotemporal patterns
- Trajectory patterns
- Mining quality phrases
- Pattern mining in data streams
- Software bug mining
- Pattern discovery for image analysis
- Privacy-preserving data mining
- Constraint-based pattern mining: data and pattern-based constraints, anti-monotone, monotone, succinct, convertible, multiple constraints
- Mining long (colossal) patterns
- Graph pattern mining: gSpan, CloseGraph, graph indexing methods, mining top-k large structural patterns in single large network, and graph mining applications such as graph indexing and similarity search in graph databases
- Pattern-based classifications, including CBA, CMAR, PatClass, DDPMine, DPClass
- frequent patterns
- closed patterns
- max-patterns
- association rules
